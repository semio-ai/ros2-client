This is a Rust native client library for [ROS2](https://docs.ros.org/en/galactic/index.html). 
It does not link to [rcl](https://github.com/ros2/rcl), 
[rclcpp](https://docs.ros2.org/galactic/api/rclcpp/index.html), or any non-Rust DDS library. 
[RustDDS](https://github.com/jhelovuo/RustDDS) is used for communication.

The API is not identical to `rclcpp` or `rclpy`, because some parts would be very awkward in Rust. For example, there are no callbacks. Rust `async` mechanism is used instead. Alternatively, some of the functionality can be polled using the Metal I/O library.

There is a `.spin()` call, but it is required only to have `ros2-client` execute some background tasks. You can spawn an async task to run it, and retain the flow of control in your code.

Please see the included examples on how to use the various features.

## Middleware backends: DDS and Zenoh

`ros2-client` can talk to ROS 2 over either of two middleware backends,
selected at compile time by **mutually exclusive** Cargo features:

* **`dds`** (default) — communicates via [RustDDS](https://github.com/jhelovuo/RustDDS),
  interoperating with ROS 2's default DDS RMWs (`rmw_fastrtps`, `rmw_cyclonedds`, …).
* **`zenoh`** — communicates via [Zenoh](https://zenoh.io/), mirroring the wire
  protocol of the official [`rmw_zenoh`](https://github.com/ros2/rmw_zenoh)
  middleware, so it interoperates with ROS 2 nodes running `rmw_zenoh`.

Exactly one backend must be enabled; the build emits a `compile_error!` if both
or neither are active. The default build uses `dds`. Build the Zenoh backend
with:

```console
cargo build --no-default-features --features zenoh
```

Run the bundled Zenoh example (a self-contained talker + listener over
loopback):

```console
cargo run --no-default-features --features zenoh --example zenoh_demo
```

### Zenoh router requirement

Like `rmw_zenoh`, the Zenoh backend discovers peers and exchanges the ROS graph
through Zenoh's infrastructure. For anything beyond a single process you
normally run a **Zenoh router** (`zenohd`), exactly as `rmw_zenoh` does, or
configure explicit peer `connect`/`listen` endpoints. The in-process examples
and tests connect two peers directly over loopback, so they need no router. See
[`docs/decisions/0009-zenoh-router-and-config.md`](docs/decisions/0009-zenoh-router-and-config.md)
for configuration details.

### Feature support on the Zenoh backend

| Capability | Zenoh backend | Notes |
| ---------- | :-----------: | ----- |
| Topics (publish/subscribe) | ✅ | CDR payload + `(seq, timestamp, gid)` attachment, per `rmw_zenoh` |
| Services (client/server)   | ✅ | Zenoh queryable / get |
| Actions                    | ✅ | Composed of services + a feedback topic, as in ROS 2 |
| Parameters + `parameter_events` | ✅ | Six `rcl_interfaces` services + events topic |
| `rosout` logging           | ✅ | `/rosout` publisher + optional reader |
| Discovery / ROS graph      | ✅ | Zenoh liveliness tokens + a graph cache |
| QoS                        | ⚠️ | Backend-neutral profile carried in liveliness keys; not all policies enforced |
| ROS 2 Security             | ❌ | DDS-only (RustDDS security) |
| Message generation (`msggen`) | ✅ | Backend-neutral |

The design, the `rmw_zenoh` mapping, and the wire-format details are documented
under [`docs/zenoh_study/`](docs/zenoh_study/); the design decisions are recorded
under [`docs/decisions/`](docs/decisions/). To validate interoperability against
a real ROS 2 + `rmw_zenoh` stack, follow
[`docs/zenoh_study/interop_runbook.md`](docs/zenoh_study/interop_runbook.md).

> **Type hashes (send direction):** REP-2016 `RIHS01_…` type hashes are emitted
> from a table of known interop types; types outside that table use a wildcard
> on receive and a placeholder on send. Computing hashes from parsed IDL is a
> tracked post-MVP follow-up (ADR-0007).

## ROS 2 Releases Compatibility

This is what is expected to work. There are no routine tests against older releases.

Select the target distribution with a Cargo feature. 

Note: The distribution features
form a chain (`galactic` < `humble` < `iron` < `jazzy` < `kilted` < `lyrical`), and enabling
any of these also enables all the older features, 
but the build aims to be compatible only with the latest enabled.

The default feature is currently  `jazzy`, because it has LTS status. 
Build against a specific
distribution with, e.g., `cargo build --no-default-features --features humble`
(`--no-default-features` avoids also pulling in the default). 

| ROS 2 Release | `ros2-client` should interoperate? |
| ------------- | :------------ |
| A - E         | Maybe. Not tested. |
| Foxy, Galactic, Humble | Yes. Build with feature `galactic` or `humble` (older Gid format). |
| Iron  | Yes. Not well tested. Build with feature `iron`. |
| Jazzy | Yes (default). Build with feature `jazzy`. |
| Kilted | Yes. Build with feature `kilted`. |
| Lyrical | Yes. Build with feature `lyrical`. |


Please see [test results](interop/results) for details.  

## Version 0.10
* Experimental **Zenoh** middleware backend (Cargo feature `zenoh`), mirroring
  `rmw_zenoh`. See "Middleware backends: DDS and Zenoh" above.
* Add interoperability tests and results.
* ROS 2 distribution selection via a feature (`galactic` .. `lyrical`; default `jazzy`). 
* `Context` now checks the `ROS_DISTRO` environment variable against the compiled distribution.
* Upgrade to RustDDS 0.13 to improve interoperability.


## Version 0.9
* Upgrade to RustDDS 0.12, which had an API change.


## Version 0.8:
* API change: `ParameterFunc` must now implement `Sync`, so that `Node` is also `Sync`. This helps in using multithreaded async executors.

### Version 0.8.1:
* `AsyncActionServer` methods changes from taking `&mut self` into `&self` for better serving
concurrent goals.
* Bump RustDDS and other depencency versions
* Add example `concurrent_action_server`
* `msggen` logging can be redirected.
* Additional unit tests, including the use of `tokio` async executor.

## New in Version 0.7:
* `NodeName` namespace is no longer allowed to be the empty string, because it confuses ROS 2 tools. Minimum namespace is "/".
* Parameter support, incl. Paramater services
* Time support

### 0.7.1
* Subscribers can `take()` samples with deserialization "seed" value. 
This allows more run-time control of deserialization. Upgrade to RustDDS 0.10.0.

### 0.7.2
* Adapt to separation of CDR encoding from RustDDS.

### 0.7.4
* Implement std `Error` trait for `NameError` and `NodeCreateError`
* Async `wait_for_writer` and `wait_for_reader` results now implement `Send`.

### 0.7.5
* New feature `pre-iron-gid`. The Gid `.msg` definition has changed between ROS2 Humble and Iron. `ros2-client` now uses the newer version by default. Use this feature to revert to the old definition.

## New in Version 0.6:

* Reworked ROS 2 Discovery implementation. Now `Node` has `.status_receiver()`
* Async `.spin()` call to run the Discovery mechanism.
* `Client` has `.wait_for_service()`
* New API for naming Nodes, Topics, Services, Actions, and data types for Topics, Actions, and Services. The new API is more structured to avoid possible confusion and errors from parsing strings.

## New in version 0.5:

* Actions are supported
* async programming interface. This should make a built-in event loop unnecessary, as Rust async executors sort of do that already. This means that `ros2-client` is not going to implement a call similar to  [`rclcpp::spin(..)`](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Concepts/Intermediate/About-Executors.html).

## Example: minimal_action_server and minimal_action_client

These are re-implementations of [similarly named ROS examples](https://docs.ros.org/en/iron/Tutorials/Intermediate/Writing-an-Action-Server-Client/Cpp.html). They should be interoperable with ROS 2 example programs in C++ or Python.

To test this, start a server and then, in a separate terminal, a client, e.g.

`ros2 run examples_rclcpp_minimal_action_server action_server_member_functions`
and
`cargo run --example=minimal_action_client`

or

`cargo run --example=minimal_action_server`
and
`ros2 run examples_rclpy_minimal_action_client client`

You should see the client requesting for a sequence of Fibonacci numbers, and the server providing them until the requested sequence length is reached.

## Example: turtle_teleop

The included example program should be able to communicate with out-of-the-box ROS2 turtlesim example.

Install ROS2 and start the simulator by ` ros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node`. Then run the `turtle_teleop` example to control the simulator.

![Turtlesim screenshot](examples/turtle_teleop/screenshot.png)

Teleop example program currently has the following keyboard commands:

* Cursor keys: Move turtle
* `q` or `Ctrl-C`: quit
* `r`: reset simulator
* `p`: change pen color (for turtle1 only)
* `a`/`b` : spawn turtle1 / turtle2
* `A`/`B` : kill turtle1 / turtle2
* `1`/`2` : switch control between turtle1 / turtle2
* `d`/`f`/`g`: Trigger or cancel absolute rotation action.

## Example: ros2_service_server

Install ROS2. This has been tested to work against "Galactic" release, using either eProsima FastDDS or RTI Connext DDS (`rmw_connextdds`, not `rmw_connext_cpp`). 

Start server: `cargo run --example=ros2_service_server`

In another terminal or computer, run a client: `ros2 run examples_rclpy_minimal_client client`

## Example: ros2_service_client

Similar to above.

Start server: `ros2 run examples_rclpy_minimal_service service`

Run client: `cargo run --example=ros2_service_client`
